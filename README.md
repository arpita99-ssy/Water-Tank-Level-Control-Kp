# Water-Tank-Level-Control-Kp
Simulation of water tank level control using proportional controller (Kp)
# Water Tank Level Control using Kp Controller

This project demonstrates a **water tank level control system**
using a **Proportional (Kp) controller**, implemented in Python.

## Description
The simulation models three water tanks and applies proportional control
to regulate tank volumes based on reference signals.
The system response is visualized using real-time animation.

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Control Concept
- Error = Reference volume − Actual volume
- Control input = Kp × Error
- Numerical integration used for system update
